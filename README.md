# Module-01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

In this mini-project, whose criteria was dictated by my Module-01 Mini Challenge as a part of my edX front-end bootcamp, I built a basic landing page using HTML and CSS. I chose a demo ticket handling page.

## Instructions

I was tasked to implement the following user stories:

* As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.
